# CÃ¢n y Ddraig

(aka Dragon's Song, aka There's Good Cyd)

A 3-channel music player for the Dragon.  Inspired by Rem's CoCoSID, this is
rewritten with a tight core and tune scripting engine.

## Quick Start

But note this is just to quickly try out SID tunes, which do *not* convert
cleanly, do *not* use the programming feature and so take up loads of
memory.  If there isn't a rule in the Makefile for the one you choose,
you'll probably have to specify some SDFLAGS for siddump to limit the
amount of time it dumps the tune for.

Needs: asm6809, bin2cas.pl, dzip, perl, siddump, sox

```
git clone https://github.com/sixxie/cyd
cd cyd
cp /path/to/Ocean_Loader_2.sid .
make SID=Ocean_Loader_2.sid
xroar cyd.bin
```

## New Stuff by S.Orchard

Added magic comments to Ciaran's example tune for easier build.

```
git clone https://github.com/sorchard001/cyd
cd cyd
make SID=example.s
xroar cyd.bin
```

Modified demo:

```
make SID=example2.s
```

The three channels may be individually configured as variable duty pulse wave generators by defining symbols in the source as required:

```
CYD_C1_PULSE	equ 1
CYD_C2_PULSE	equ 1
CYD_C3_PULSE	equ 1
```

The pulse wave duty is configured with new commands in the music source:

	fcb	setplscfg,reset_mode,cycle_mode
	fcb	setplsduty,duty_val,rate_val

where:

**reset_mode** is either **CYD_DUTY_RESET** or **CYD_DUTY_NORST** (controls whether the duty is reset to the start value or not when a new note starts)

**cycle_mode** is either **CYD_DUTY_CYCLE** or **CYD_DUTY_SWEEP** (controls whether the duty is allowed to cycle endlessly or stop before it reaches a value in the range 128-255)

**duty_val** sets the current duty and start duty (range 0 to 255. Use a value of 128 for a 50% duty square wave)

**rate_val** sets the rate at which the duty is varied (range -128 to 127)


(Work in progress: Note frequency table calculation does not currently take into account the actual cycle counts resulting from the channel configuration)
