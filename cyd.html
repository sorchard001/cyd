<h1>Cân y Ddraig (CyD)</h1>

<p>A 3-channel music player for the Dragon. Inspired by Rem's CoCoSID, this is
rewritten with a tight core and tune scripting engine.

<h2>Waves, Envelopes and Patches</h2>

<p>Waves are the basic sound element. Each wave is 256 bytes, and page-aligned
so that only an 8 bit value is required to reference it. They will usually
form one cycle of a particular waveform shape (e.g., square or sawtooth).

<p>Because we don't have enough CPU time to dynamically calculate an ADSR
(Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) sound envelope, an envelope here is simply
defined as a list of wave identifiers (which is the first 8 bits of their
address), ending in a zero byte. A special label, <code>envelope_0</code> is
expected to point to a silent envelope, and is used by the <code>silence</code>
command.

<p>A patch is simply a pair of envelopes - intended to represent first the
Attack/Decay/Sustain (ADS) portion of an instrument, and then the Release (R)
portion - plus a envelope timer for the ADS portion. Whenever a new note is
played, the current envelope and timer is reset to the ADS data.

<p>Patch data is 5 bytes: ADS timer (1 byte), ADS pointer (2 bytes), R pointer
(2 bytes). cyd.s expects to find a table labelled <code>patch_table</code>,
into which the <code>setpatch</code> command will index.

<h2>Writing a tune</h2>

<p><code>tune_table</code> contains an entry per tune. Each entry is a series
of three 16-bit addresses: the absolute base address of the tune data for each
of the three channels.

<p>Each channel's tune data consists of a series of commands. Probably one of
the first commands before any notes should be <code>setpatch</code> so that
when the tune loops, the appropriate patch is re-selected. To keep the code
small, there are plenty of limitations in this bytecode.

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<dl>

<dt><code>FCB setpatch,<var>patch</var></code>

<dd>Set the patch for this channel.

<dt><code>FCB setport,<var>df</var></code>

<dd>Set portamento. Note frequency will have <var>df</var> added to it after
each fragment is played. Remains in effect indefinitely, so set to zero when
done. Frequency values aren't in Hz, they're in units of 71 (or 70) cpu cycles.

<dt><code>FCB settp,<var>dn</var></code>

<dd>Transposition. Subsequent notes will be offset by <var>dn</var> semitones.
No tests are made to ensure the transposed notes are in range.

</dl>

<h3>Notes &amp; rests</h3>

<dl>

<dt><code>FCB silence,<var>duration</var></code>

<dd>Silence channel and wait for <var>duration</var>.

<dt><code>FCB rest,<var>duration</var></code>

<dd>Wait for <var>duration</var>. Doesn't do anything to the current envelope.

<dt><code>FCB xrest,<var>duration</var></code>

<dd>Wait for <var>duration</var>. Delays envelope processing.

<dt><code>FCB setnote,<var>n</var>,<var>duration</var></code>

<dd>Set the playing note to <var>n</var> without restarting the envelope.

<dt><code>FCB $80+<var>n</var>,<var>duration</var></code>

<dd>Play note <var>n</var>. Envelope is reset. Note numbers are based on MIDI,
with note 69 being A4, that is 440Hz. Increment is in semitones, so 70 is
A<sup>♯</sup>4 (B<sup>♭</sup>4) and 68 is G<sup>♯</sup>4 (A<sup>♭</sup>4). The
frequency table generation script also includes convenience labels for notes;
from <code>c0</code> ($80+12) to <code>g8</code> ($80+115). Sharps have labels
like <code>cs4</code>.

</dl>

<h3>Program flow</h3>

<dl>

<dt><code>FCB jump</code>
<dt><code>FDB <var>address</var></code>

<dd>Subsequent commands executed from <var>address</var>. You probably want one
of these at the end of your tune data to loop back to the beginning.

<dt><code>FCB loop,<var>count</var></code>

<dd>Loop <var>count</var> times up to the <code>next</code> command. Note: only
one loop per channel at a time - no nesting!

<dt><code>FCB next</code>

<dd>Indicate end of looped code.

<dt><code>FCB call</code>
<dt><code>FDB <var>address</var></code>

<dd>Subroutine call. Commands are executed from <var>address</var>. When a
<code>return</code> command is encountered, return to the caller. Again note:
only one call per channel - no nesting.

<dt><code>FCB calltp, <var>dn</var></code>
<dt><code>FDB <var>address</var></code>

<dd>Call with transpose. Shortcut for a <code>settp</code> command followed by
a <code>call</code> command.

<dt><code>FCB return</code>

<dd>Return to caller.

</dl>

<h2>Calling the player</h2>

<p>Initialise <code>DP</code> to point the the right place. If you want to use
a different <code>DP</code> for your own things in between calls to the player,
you must set it up before each call.

<p>If necessary, configure the PIAs so that only the DAC bits are outputs. For
speed, no masking of the lower bits is performed, which may interfere with
connected printers. Ensure the DAC is selected for output to the sound bus. See
the test harness for an example of this (search for the <code>start</code>
label).

<p>Select a tune by loading the <code>A</code> register with its index and call
<code>select_tune</code>.

<p>Then, simply call <code>play_frag</code> each time you want a fragment of
audio to be emitted (e.g., in a loop while waiting for a keypress).

<h2>Code notes</h2>

<p>Self-modifying code is used throughout for speed. Don't expect to embed this
in a ROM unless you copy the main playback routine into RAM first.  The most
critical variables are the current wave id and frequency for each channel
(<code>c<i>n</i>wave</code> and <code>c<i>n</i>freq</code>), as they sit within
the tight fragment playing loop.

<p>It's important that the main play loop, starting with
<code>mixer_loop</code>, be entirely contained with the Direct Page. It's just
as important that all the waveform data be page-aligned. As long as you set the
code origin (<code>ORG</code>) to be page-aligned and don't reorganise it,
these conditions will be met. The waveform data comes first (256 bytes each),
followed by a 128-entry note to frequency table (<code>ftable</code>, 256
bytes), followed by the Direct Page variables &amp; code.

<p>By default, CyD is built with a 71 cycle core mixer. If built with
<code>make VSYNC=1</code> the <samp>Makefile</samp> will pass appropriate arguments to the
scripts and assembler to build with a 70 cycle core mixer that depends on VSYNC
for its timing instead of using a counter, thus tying it to a PAL (or NTSC)
system. As a bonus, FAST CPU rate is enabled for tune processing in this mode,
as the VDG is guaranteed to be outside the active area once an audio fragment
is done.

<h2>Tips &amp; tricks</h2>

<p>A key change for a phrase can be written without having to transcribe all
the notes again: make that section a <code>call</code>ed routine. Set a
transposition offset (in semitones) and call that routine in one command with
<code>calltp</code>.

<p>Envelopes are fairly long-winded: the ADS portion must be represented in its
entirety - a byte per fragment duration - until the sustain value, which for
slow decays can add up. However, patch definitions point directly to the
envelope, so if the definition of one envelope matches the end portion of an
existing one, just make the patch point into the existing one.

<p>A common trick on the C64 to give the appearance of more channels, was to
play a short burst of noise before playing a note, thus providing a "drum beat"
while still keeping the channel mostly free for melody or bassline. CyD
"envelope"s are completely arbitrary sequences of wave ids, so this is easily
accomplished by making the first fragment a noise waveform.

<p>And of course the two previous tricks can be combined so that you have one
patch indicating percussion-then-note, and another with just the note without
needing to replicate envelope data.

<p>There's nothing to stop you calling a routine that plays a series of notes
multiple times with different patches selected.

<p>The duration of each channel need not be the same, though it would usually
be a good idea. If one channel is a simple repeating bassline, you might only
need to include the notes for it in an infinite loop (using <code>jump</code>).

<h2>SID?</h2>

<p>CyD was inspired by CoCoSID, but the programmatic approach (rather than
pattern-based) is supposed to provide the ability to create quite compact sets
of tunes. However, SIDs were the obvious way of testing, so this comes with a
Perl script to translate a SID file into data suitable for CyD. Just be aware
that the data will be far too large to be practical, as no attempt is made to
recognise patterns.

<p>This script is called <samp>sidparse.pl</samp>. It depends on
<samp>siddump</samp> for its operation. Feed the standard output of
<samp>siddump</samp> to the standard input of <samp>sidparse.pl</samp>.

<p><samp>sidparse.pl</samp> does a reasonable job of generating envelope data
so long as the SID tune doesn't pull too many fancy tricks - e.g., filter
sweeps will probably appear as note data.

<p>The provided <samp>Makefile</samp> will string these tools together for you.
Just call it with <code>make SID=<var>path/to/sid_file</var></code>.  e.g.,
assuming a subdirectory called <samp>sid</samp> containing all your SID files:

<pre>
$ make SID=sid/Ghosts_n_Goblins.sid
</pre>

<p>Override <code>SDFLAGS</code> to provide flags to <samp>siddump</samp> (you
can see various examples of this in the <samp>Makefile</samp>). This will
almost certainly be necessary to limit the duration so you don't overrun
available memory.

<p>A selection of pre-built examples is included with this upload - they'll all
cut off early, loop badly, and use far more memory than they need to in the
process, but they give good examples of the sort of sounds that can be
achieved.
